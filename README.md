# ColorTheSound
A modified version of the app **ColorMyViews** from the [Android App Development in Kotlin Course on Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/developing-android-apps-with-kotlin--ud9012)

The ColorMyViews app is a sample game application that allows users to color boxes and the background by clicking on them. This app showcases several views and techniques, including:

- Creating layouts using the Layout Editor

- Using the ConstraintView to scale items for different devices and orientation

- In the Layout Editor: Creating chains, aligning objects, using baseline alignment for labels

### Added Feature

 Added WAV files as a resource and used these sound clips to trigger when the user clicks on the boxes, while also coloring them in.
